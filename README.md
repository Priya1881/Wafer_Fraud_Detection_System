# Wafer_Fraud_Detection_System
The objective of this project is to detect the quality of the wafer sensors based on the data produced by the connected device
The data is continuously streamed through the device reader into the database.
Prediction is done on the batch files created by the device reader.
 
 KMeans and XGBoost classifier are used for creating clusters and classification models respectively. AUC scores for best score.
